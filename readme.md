# Yet Another Url Shortner (yaus)


## a little project to play with ASP.NET Core

I finally found time to try out .NET core. As you probably guessed, 
this is just a simple web site that implements an URL shortner.
The token generation is pretty primative and the storage is completely
memory based. All compromises so that I could stand up something simple.
